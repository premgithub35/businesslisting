              5.2 This Website contains a large number of menus items. Although we take great care to
               keep them up to date, it is always possible that some of the menus may be incorrectly 
               priced. If the correct price for an order is higher than the price stated on the Website,
                RailMitra will normally contact you before the order in question is dispatched. 
                RailMitra is under no obligation to ensure that the order is provided to you at the 
                incorrect lower price or to compensate you in respect of incorrect pricing.
